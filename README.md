# OCI Helm Charts Mirror

This is a stop-gap mirror of OCI Helm Charts that can be used until maintainers of upstream charts publish them. See the issue [here](https://github.com/szinn/charts-mirror/issues/6) for tracking the progress of upstream support for OCI charts added here.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you wish to use these charts understand it is **your responsiblity to make sure to change to the official OCI chart as soon as possible** as they will be deprecated here. I bare **no resposibility** for you **not paying close attention to this repository and the changes herein**.

## Usage

```sh
helm install ${NAME} --namespace ${NAMESPACE} oci://ghcr.io/szinn/charts-mirror/${CHART} --version ${VERSION}

```

## Contributing

1. Verify the chart doesn't already have an official OCI Helm Chart.
2. Create a new directory under `charts/` with the chart name.
3. Add a `metadata.yaml` to that new directory file with the contents and update the variables to reflect the chart you are adding:

    ```yaml
    ---
    registry: ${REGISTRY_URL}
    chart: ${CHART_NAME}
    version: ${CHART_VERSION}
    ```

4. Open a PR with the link in the description to the upstream issue tracking OCI Helm Chart support.
